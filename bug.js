This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. In React Native, this often happens when you're working with asynchronous data fetching or when dealing with components that may not be mounted yet. For example, you might try to access `this.state.user.name` before the `user` object has been fully populated, resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.  Another scenario is accessing a ref to a component that hasn't rendered yet.
